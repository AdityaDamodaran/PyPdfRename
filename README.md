### Too many academic papers in pdf format with random or unintelligble filenames in your documents folder?

### Things not looking up in the stock market?

### Is life starting to feel too monotonous, and are you looking for the true meaning of life?

PyPdfRename can help with the first issue.

Pass a directory path to this script as an argument, and it will attempt to guess what the pdf files in this directory are about by reading their titles, and will then offer to rename them for you.
